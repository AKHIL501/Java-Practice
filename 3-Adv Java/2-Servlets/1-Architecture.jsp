	Important topics:-
					1.JDBC
					2.Servlets
					3.JSP
					4.JSTL

	According to sun  microsystem Java 3 parts:
					1.J2SE (JDBC)
					2.J2EE	(Servlets.JSP,JSTL)
					3.J2ME

	Web Application :- Web Application contains client server architectute.
	Deployment:- The process of placing the server into project  this process is called deployment process.

		Servers and Jar files:- 
				  1.Tomcat (Apache software foundation)------->servlet-api.jar
				  2.GlassFish (Sunmicro systems)------->jee.jar
				  3.WebLogic (Orcle corporation)------->weblogic.jar
				  4.Webspiar (IBM)
				  5.Jbos Server (Jbos community)

	Deploy project into server at least we can prepare that projects in Servlets.

	Client side :- The technologies which are used to write in client side applications

		JDBC:- Provide communication between java application to database.
		Servlets:- Servlets are used to write the programs in server side that are executed by server only.
		JSP:-		Develop both client side and server side applications.


		3 ALyers of Web application:

				1.Presentation layer :-Client side development
				2.Business layer	:- Java Programs , Servlets, JSP , Springs
				3. Persistence layer	:-JDBC hibernates

		Type of appplications using java:
				
					1.J2EE
						i.Standalone---> Ex :- calculator --->Swings,AWT,JavaFX 
						ii.Client-server--->Ex:- hospital billing ---> java.net
					2.J2SE
						i.Web Applications:-Servlets,	EJB
						
						
						Browser--->data converts into ---> http protocol-------->java beans----> servlet--->jdbc
